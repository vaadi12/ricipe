STEP 1: You have to take a cup of glass for a pack and put it on your source of heat with maggi and it's pouder.
STEP 2: Give heat to it until it cook properly it may take 10 min. or something[I know maggi's company say that
        maggi as"5 min. maggi" but belive me it never gonna cook in 5 min.🙄🙄 it takes about 10 min.😣😣]

After soemtime your maggi is ready and eat it!😁😁
